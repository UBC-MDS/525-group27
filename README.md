# Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia

DSCI 525 (Web and Cloud Computing) Group 27

## Project goal

Our project aims to use various Big Data techniques, including parallel processing and machine learning to construct models on [rainfall](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) big dataset (~6 GB). This will be done by predicting daily rainfall in Australia using ensemble machines that have been constructed from our data set.
